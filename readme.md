Embedded Programming files for PIC16F877A microcontroller by microchip technologies.

Files include various Peripheral Programming as well as makefiles and build files created by the MPLAB X IDE for microcontroller programming. The datasheets and schematics are included as well for reference

This is a part of my internship on Embedded Systems and Microcontroller Program in Emertxe Information Technologies.

*Ignore the SWIG and Makefile files they are just there as a part of the microcontroller build which is essential for operation*
